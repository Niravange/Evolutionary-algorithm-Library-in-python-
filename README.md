An evolutionary algorithm is a computer application focused on evolutionary AI that solves problems by using mechanisms that imitate the actions of living things. 
As a result, it employs processes such as reproduction, mutation, and recombination that are often associated with biological evolution.
The objective function specifies the problem to be solved.  Depending on how “good” the given individual is fitted to the objective function,
the value which represents its quality is attributed to it.  This value is referred to as the individual's fitness, and it is a major determining factor.
Individuals that are highly valued have a greater probability of being chosen for the next generation of the population.

ABOUT DEMENTIA
Early detection of dementia and its type is hard to predict through the traditional approach. Machine Learning plays a crucial role in the field of neurodegenerative disorders as it helps to understand the underlying patterns and relations to provide the right care and support.
Dementia is an emerging health issue in developing countries. An early and accurate diagnosis can contribute to more effective treatment.
